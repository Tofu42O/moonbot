## How to use
First create a application on the [discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
Then go to OAUTH2 > general > scopes, press bot, and then administrator.
Then go to OAUTH2 > URL generator, click on "bot" in Scopes and generate and url
Then copy the url and invite it to a server you have administrator permissions on!

For now you can use the bot by:
1. Copying the code and run it on your personal computer
2. Running the bot through my [replit](https://replit.com/@rasm273z/rolimonsbot) and replacing token in the secrets folder with your token
*In the future i will create a bot that you can just invite to your server through a simple link*

**How to get token?**
Go to your application you made and then press the "Bot" with a ðŸ§© logo
Press "reset token" and there you have your token, be sure to remember it and don't share it with others!
